## Development setup

### middleman
[Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/) is a static site generator tool and is used to develop this project. Middleman is coded in ruby and uses bundle to manage the dependencies.

To setup the environment to play with the code just run the commands below (assuming ruby and bundler are installed; you can use http://rvm.io/ to install them if you don't have them):

```
$ bundle
$ bundle exec middleman server
```

Then just open your browser and visit [localhost:4567](http://localhost:4567)
